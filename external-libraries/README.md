External Libraries
==================

This example show how to modify the `webpack.config.js` file in order to `require` external libraries from modules.

The straight example is to link _jQuery_ from a _CDN_ but be able to write `var $ = require('jquery');` inside app's modules.

    // quick start:
    npm install && gulp
