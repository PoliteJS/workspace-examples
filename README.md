Workspace Examples!
===================

This repository contains some example application and code that you can use to learn and
drive your _Workspace_ development experience.

## Chrome Canary Only!

As they are meant to be pure examples I wrote and tested those apps only with _Google Chrome Canary_, I don't know if they are compatible with other browsers and I do not guarantee that.

> This code is for showing concepts, it is not meant to copy & pase.  
> **Do not use this code in production!**

## NPM Install & Build

Every app in this repository is a _Workspace_ app that needs to be properly installed:
    
    // quick bootstrap an example
    npm install && gulp show

## Report Errors and Improvements

I write this code in my spare time, on the couch, drinking coffee a lot. It's likely late during the night, normal people sleeps all around me. **I do typos and bugs.**

This repository is meant for people to learn so if you find typos or bug pleas [report it on the issues](https://github.com/PoliteJS/workspace-examples/issues), or better, **fork, fix and pull request me!**

## Ask For Examples

I don't know what you would like to use the _Workspace_ for and I don't believe this is the right solution to address any kind of web app development scenario... 

but if you have a specific situation/scenario you would like to be solved as an exercise don't exitate to write it as an [issue in the repo](https://github.com/PoliteJS/workspace-examples/issues)!
