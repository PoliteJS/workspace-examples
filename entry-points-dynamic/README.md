Dynamic Single Page App
=======================

This example show how to create a **dynamic entry point** web page application using KnockoutJS 
Components as UI modules to give structure to the app.

    // quick start:
    npm install && gulp
    
This example is the optimised version of _monolithc single page application_. 

Instead of loading all the UI modules here **we load only the code that is involved in the first page rendering**.

> The other modules are dynamically downloaded on demand.
